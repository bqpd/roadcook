\begin{recipe}{Overnight Bread}{1 loaf}{}
\freeform The best excuse to have (most of) a beer.
\ing[3]{cups}{flour}
\ing[1/4]{tsp}{yeast}
\ing[1 1/2]{tsp}{salt}
\ing[3/8]{cup}{beer}
\ing[7/8]{cup}{water}
\ing[2]{T}{white vinegar}
\ing[]{}{rosemary, garlic, walnuts, cheddar, jalepeno}
Mix all the ingredients together and cover with seran wrap. Let rise for 8-24 hours. Punch down, knead three times and then shape into a ball and put it in an oven-proof pot or dutch oven that will allow for rising on parchment paper. Loosely cover with seran wrap and let rise (2 hours before baking). 30 minutes before baking, put the dutch oven or oven-proof pot in 500 F oven (remove the bread first) with lid. Put bread in the pot after 30 minutes with the lid on. Bake at 425F for 30 minutes and then take the lid off (and maybe turn the heat down a little bit). Cook for another 20 minutes or until done.
