\begin{recipe}{Zucchini Pancakes (aka Goop)}{}{}
\freeform Got any abnormally large zucchinis begging to be eaten?
\ing[1/2]{cup}{farina (cream of wheat)}
\ing[]{}{water}
\ing[1]{cup-ish}{zucchini (grated)}
\ing[1]{ear}{corn}
\ing[1/2]{}{sweet onion}
\ing[1-2]{pinches}{salt}
\ing[1]{sprinkling}{red chilli flakes}
\ing[to taste]{}{ground pepper}
\ing[3-4]{}{eggs}
Pour the farina in a bowl and add just enough water to be absorbed. Then add everything else to the bowl and stir it up. Fry like pancakes in a pan or scramble like eggs. It is equally delicious either way!
\end{recipe}
