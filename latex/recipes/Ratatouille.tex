\begin{recipe}{Ratatouille}{}{40 min, }
\freeform Easiest thing to make that tastes incredibly complex and delicious.
\ing[1-2]{eggplant}{zucchini}
\ing[]{}{1 large}
\ing[6]{}{tomatoes}
\ing[1]{}{white onion}
Saut√© the onion with a few cloves of garlic and then throw in the rest of the ingredients. Add salt and pepper to taste, as well as any desired assortment of herbs. I like dried basil, oregano, thyme or anything similar that happens to be in the cupboard. Cook down for 20+ minutes until everything joins together and becomes an almost soupy texture.
