\begin{recipe}{Whey Bread}{2 loaves}{}
\freeform The perfect post-cheese making creation.
\ing[3]{cups}{warm whey}
\ing[1]{T}{yeast}
\ing[1]{tsp}{salt}
\ing[1/4]{cup}{sugar}
\ing[7]{cups}{flour}
In a large bowl, combine water, yeast, sugar, and salt. Let sit five minutes. Stir in first three cups of flour with a heavy spoon. Add the next cup of flour a little at a time as needed, stirring until dough becomes too stiff to continue stirring easily. Add a little more flour and begin kneading. The amount of flour is approximateâ€“your mileage may vary! Continue adding flour and kneading until the dough is smooth and elastic. Let dough rise in a greased, covered bowl until doubled. (Usually, about an hour.) Uncover bowl; sprinkle in a little more flour and knead again before dividing in half. With floured hands, shape dough into loaves and place in two greased loaf pans. Tear off two pieces of waxed paper and grease with oil spray (to prevent it from sticking to the loaves as they rise) and cover loaf pans. Let rise till loaves are tall and beautiful! (About an hour, depending on the temperature in your kitchen.) Bake for 25 minutes in a preeheated 350 F oven.
