\begin{recipe}{Coconut Sticky Rice}{}{}
\freeform A college friend favourite since the first time I made it.
\ing[1]{cup}{sweet rice}
Soak in water for 3-24 hours. Then drain the water off and transfer to a pot. Add just a little bit of water (enough to make it not burn on the bottom, but little enough to make it sticky!). Cook on low until done, 20-30 minutes. 5-10 minutes before the rice is done, start making the sauce.
\ing[1]{can}{coconut milk}
\ing[1/2]{cup}{sugar}
\ing[2]{tsp}{salt}
Slowly bring to a boil and then pour over the rice (once it has finished cooking). Top with fresh mango or whatever you please. (Add less salt and sugar if so desired.
\end{recipe}
