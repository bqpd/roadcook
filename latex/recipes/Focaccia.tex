Shape the dough into a round, coat with a little oil, and let rise until doubled (around 30m). Press into the pan (as much as possible - it may be quite elastic) and let rise, covered, 30m.
 Preheat your oven as high as it will go. Go back to the dough; spread it out to the sides of the pan, then use your fingertips to poke holes across the whole surface, all the way to the bottom. Drizzle the top generously with olive oil, then use your palms to press salt and rosemary on it. Bake for about 10 minutes (until golden brown on top), then turn the oven down to 400 and bake for another 10m. 
\freeform Let cool on a wire rack before serving.
